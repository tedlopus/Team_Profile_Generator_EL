# Team_Profile_Generator_EL
This application allows you to generate profiles for a software engineering team based on the information inputted by the user.
## Description

Each profile has a name and id along with there role. Each role has slightly differing profiles: Managers have an office number, Engineers have a github profile, and Interns have a school they attended or are attending.
